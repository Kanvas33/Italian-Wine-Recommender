## Web App integration *Under Development.*

## Project Overview

This **Python project is dedicated to wine enthusiasts worldwide**, offering a selection of top-notch Italian wines. With a database of almost 130,000 wines from around the globe, I've curated a list of **approximately 5,000 Italian wines that have received exceptional ratings between 90 and 100**. The aim is to assist wine lovers in discovering the perfect Italian wine to complement their meals. '**The Italian Wine Recommender**' provides a list of the **top 10** wines that are **most similar to your preferences within the dataset**, achieved through meticulous **statistical analysis**.

## Project Objectives

- Curate a collection of the finest Italian wines.
- Develop a wine recommendation system based on **NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms**.
- Provide wine enthusiasts with **personalized** wine recommendations.
- Create an interactive **Web Application** for a seamless user experience.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Collection**: I gathered data on over 120,000 wines from various regions worldwide, filtering out the **top-rated Italian wines**.

- **Analysis**: The **backend** of the project includes **in-depth analysis**, utilizing **libraries** such as **pandas, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, sklearn.metrics.pairwise, langdetect, and googletrans**.

- **Frontend Development**: The **frontend of the Web Application** is designed using **HTML and CSS**. You can preview the Web app homepage GIF above.

- **Integration (Work in Progress)**: Our ongoing work involves **integrating the backend with the frontend** to provide users with personalized wine recommendations based on their preferences.

## Language Support

The Web App project is designed to be **user-friendly and inclusive**. It accepts user input in both **English and Italian languages** to facilitate interaction with users from various linguistic backgrounds.

## Achievements and Insights

- Curated a database of 5,000 high-quality Italian wines.
- Implemented **NLP-powered algorithms for wine recommendations**.
- Designed an aesthetically pleasing Web App frontend.
- Completed the backend analysis, ready for integration.

## Conclusion

While this **static version** of '**The Italian Wine Recommender**' project provides a glimpse into what's to come, I am **actively working** on the **interactive Web Application**. The future holds exciting prospects for wine enthusiasts, as they will soon have the ability to receive tailored **wine recommendations based on their preferences**.

Feedback and suggestions are **welcome**, as I continue to develop and refine this project.
